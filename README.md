# Rename Video Files with Baseball Data
 With this code, you can rename your video clips from a game with pitch information from a Tackman or Yakkertech CSV. This assumes that each pitch has a video associated with it!

This can be especially useful when working with Edgertronic clips when every pitch is captured in a bullpen or side!
